# Coffee Aroma Analysis

## Stage 2: Developing a research question and analysis

This analysis is done on the coffee ratings dataset it is focused on coffee aroma grade and origin country for coffee beans to answer the research questions listed here.  

## Research Questions

1.  Do origin countries for coffee beans really affect coffee aroma grade? <br />
2. Can I create a model to predict coffee aroma grade base on Flavor grade or Acidity grade?<br />
3. Can Flavor grade predict coffee Aroma grade?<br />
4. Dose Acidity will improve the prediction and model performance?
